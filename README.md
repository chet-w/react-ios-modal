## Getting started

To install the package, install it as a dependency using either yarn or npm

```bash
# with yarn
$ yarn add @chet-w/react-ios-modal

# with npm
$ npm install @chet-w/react-ios-modal
```

## Usage

`react-ios-modal` relies on using Context to handle summoning the Modal, and Hooks to manage setting the Content to whatever to you want.

1. Wrap your app in a `ModalProvider`

```tsx
// index.tsx or as high up in yout component tree as you want

import { ModalProvider } from "@chet-w/react-ios-modal";
import App from "./App";

const MyApp = (): React.FC => (
  <ModalProvider>
    <App />
  </ModalProvider>
);
```

2. Once your app is a child of `ModalProvider`, you have access to the `useModal` hook, which lets you open, close, and set the content of the Modal.

3. Create your Modal as separate Component, and pass it in to the `openModal` function returned from `useModal`.

```tsx
// App.tsx
import { Modal, useModal } from "@chet-w/react-ios-modal";

const App = (): React.FC => {
  const { openModal } = useModal();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Some content for my app.</p>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => openModal(<MyModal />)}>
        Open Modal
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

const MyModal = (): React.FC => {
  <Modal id="demo-modal" title="A demo modal">
    <p>My first Modal</p>
  </Modal>;
};
```
